/**
Before starting the scripts need to:
  - Create database, restore latest version of TOMs_Test and create relevant pg service
  - Get project folder structure and rename appropriate files
  - Change service name in project file
  - Run this script
  - Within QGIS, add relevant layers into project and transfer to database:
      - os_mastermap_topography_text
      - os_mastermap_topography_polygons
      - SiteArea
      - RoadCentreLine (remember to only include selected items)
